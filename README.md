# Minecraft Loot Table Parser
Simple python script for parsing minecraft loot table files and presenting the information in an understandable way.

## Introduction
The intent of this loot table parser is to be a relatively minimalistic solution to parsing loot tables in both vanilla Minecraft and datapacks. Currently it only gives a summary list of items in a loot table and their relative weights.

## Technologies
Python 3.8

## Setup
Currently the script needs to be pointed directly to the folder containing the loot table files manually. I am planning on changing this so it just needs to be placed in the right folder and it will do all the work when run.

## Project Status
Under development

I plan on creating a simple script that only needs to be placed in a folder with the relevant files and run to produce a more legible version of the loot table data. Once this is done I may add statistical analysis, GUI, and other QoL features.
